//! Hook system for custom commands
//!
//! Provides a flexible hook system that can execute scripts or commands
//! at different stages (pre, post) with ordering and parallel execution support.
//!
//! ## Execution Model
//!
//! - Hooks are executed before and after applying dotfiles
//! - Different order values execute sequentially (order 10 before order 20)
//! - Hooks with the same order value execute **in parallel** for maximum performance
//! - Supports execution modes: Always, Once, OnChange
//!
//! ## Module Organization
//!
//! - `config`: Hook configuration structures (Hook, HookCollections, etc.)
//! - `loader`: Hook discovery and loading from filesystem
//! - `executor`: Hook execution engine with parallel support
//! - `state`: Hook configuration state tracking (separate from execution state)
